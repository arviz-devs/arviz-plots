# Adding a batteries-included plot
Each batteries-included plot should have its own file within the `/src/arviz-plots/plots` folder.

:::{important}
Batteries-included plots provide opinionated defaults for common EABM tasks.
Consequently, setting those defaults should represent a significant part of both
the code itself and the work done.

In fact, there are cases where getting the function to work is easier than
managing to generate sensible defaults for the different parameter combinations.
:::

### Initial defaults


### PlotCollection dependent defaults


### Computation


### `.map` usage pattern
