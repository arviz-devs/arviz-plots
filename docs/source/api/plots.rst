Batteries-included plots
========================

Batteries-included plotting functions are available at the ``arviz_plots``
top level namespace and provide plug and play opinionated solutions
to common tasks within the Bayesian workflow.

Each of the entries below describe the behaviour of each function, all its arguments
and include a handful of examples of each.
A complementary introduction and guide to ``plot_...`` functions is available at :ref:`plots_intro`.
