# Coverage ECDF

Coverage refers to the proportion of true values that fall within a given prediction interval.
For a well-calibrated model, the coverage should match the intended interval width. For example,
a 95% credible interval should contain the true value 95% of the time.
As a result, the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) of these intervals should be
uniformly distributed.

To make the plot easier to interpret, we plot the Î”-ECDF, that is, the difference between
the expected CDF from the observed ECDF. As small deviations from uniformity are expected, 
the plot also shows the credible envelope.
