# PIT-ECDF

Faceted plot with PIT Δ-ECDF values for each variable

The ``plot_ecdf_pit`` function assumes the values passed to it has already been transformed
to PIT values, as in the case of SBC analysis or values from ``arviz_base.loo_pit``.

The distribution should be uniform if the model is well-calibrated. 

To make the plot easier to interpret, we plot the Δ-ECDF, that is, the difference between
the expected CDF from the observed ECDF. As small deviations from uniformity are expected, 
the plot also shows the credible envelope.
