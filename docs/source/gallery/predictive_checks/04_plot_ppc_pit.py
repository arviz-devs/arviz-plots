# PIT ECDF

Plot of $p(\tilde y_i \le y_i \mid y)$, where $y_i$ represents the observed data for index $i$
and $\tilde y_i$ represents the posterior predictive sample at index $i$.

The distribution should be uniform if the model is well-calibrated. 

To make the plot easier to interpret, we plot the Î”-ECDF, that is, the difference between
the expected CDF from the observed ECDF. As small deviations from uniformity are expected, 
the plot also shows the credible envelope.
