# Coverage ECDF

Coverage refers to the proportion of true values that fall within a given prediction interval.
For a well-calibrated model, the coverage should match the intended interval width. For example,
a 95% credible interval should contain the true value 95% of the time.

The distribution should be uniform if the model is well-calibrated. 

To make the plot easier to interpret, we plot the Î”-ECDF, that is, the difference between
the expected CDF from the observed ECDF. As small deviations from uniformity are expected, 
the plot also shows the credible envelope. 

We can compute the coverage for equal-tailed intervals (ETI) by passing `coverage=True` to the
`plot_ppc_pit` function. This works because ETI coverage can be obtained by transforming the PIT
values. However, for other interval types, such as HDI, coverage must be computed explicitly and
is not supported by this function.
