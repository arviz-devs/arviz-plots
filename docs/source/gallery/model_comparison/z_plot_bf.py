# Bayes_factor

Compute Bayes factor using Savageâ€“Dickey ratio. 

We can apply this function when the null model is nested within the alternative.
In other words when the null (`ref_val``) is a particular value of the model we are
building (see [here](https://statproofbook.github.io/P/bf-sddr.html)).

For others cases computing Bayes factor is not straightforward and requires more complex
methods. Instead, of computing Bases factors, we usually recommend using Paretto smoothed
importance sampling leave one out cross validation (PSIS-LOO-CV).
